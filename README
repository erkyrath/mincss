MinCSS: A minimal CSS parser
Pre-release

This is an experimental CSS parser, written in C. You don't want to
use it.

At this point it is a proof of concept. It can parse a CSS file into
a memory structure, but all it can do with that structure is print it
back out (for unit tests).

Yes, there's plenty of CSS parsing code in the world. I need a minimal
CSS parser with no dependencies as part of an IF-related project. This
code may wind up being that parser. Or not. I haven't decided yet.
