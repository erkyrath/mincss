MinCSS: A minimal CSS parser
Pre-release

This is an experimental CSS parser, written in C. You don't want to
use it.

It is not functional at this point. It has a lexer, which can turn a CSS
file into a token stream, but there's no parser per se.

Yes, there's plenty of CSS parsing code in the world. I need a minimal
CSS parser with no dependencies as part of an IF-related project. This
code may wind up being that parser. Or not. I haven't decided yet.
